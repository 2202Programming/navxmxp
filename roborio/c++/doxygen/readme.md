The navX MXP C++ Library for RoboRIO provides an interface to "Attitude/Heading Reference System" (AHRS) functionality.

The AHRS Class provides this interface.  To use the AHRS class, instantiate the class using one of the constructors.
Several constructors are provided, depending upon which navX MXP communications interface is selected.  For more
information on selecting the appropriate communications interface, please see <a href="http://navx-mxp.kauailabs.com/guidance/selecting-an-interface/">"Selecting an Interface".</a>

The navX MXP C++ Library for RoboRIO is based upon the C++ WPI Library.

For source code and Eclipse Project files which demonstrate using the AHRS class, please see the <a href="http://navx-mxp.kauailabs.com/examples/">navX MXP Examples</a>.
