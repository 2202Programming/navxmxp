This library was developed for the nav6 IMU, and will be ported to the RoboRio, as soon as the RoboRio WPI libraries are made publicly available.

At that time, this library will be updated to add interfaces for accessing the new functionality in the navX MXP, including 9-axis headings and motion detection.
